            This website is mainly a place for me to play with new technologies and experiment with different ideas.
            Lately I've been drawn to htmx and wanted to give building a server/router using Go's fantastic <code
                class="j-inline-code">net/http</code> package a <em>go</em>.
            I also wanted to try and build a website that can be compiled into a single binary and run on a server
            without any dependencies, including
            all of the images, css files and html templates using the <code class="j-inline-code">embed</code> package.

            Check out the carousel below that is permutated by the server! If you load up two instances of this website,
            you should see the same sequence of images offset by the time difference between loading up both instances.
            It's not practical at all, but I thought it would be cool to use some goroutines, channels and dead simple
            htmx to make it work by managing some global application state on the server side.

            This website also serves as a test bed for a router that I am writing to learn more about how http servers
            work. Who knows,
            this may become a separate project in the future! Although it must be said that there are many great Go
            based routers out there today,
            two of my favourite being <a class="j-link" href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">chi</a> and <a

            What is this god awful colour scheme you ask? Well the palette is from the VSCode theme I use, which is a
            <em>very slightly</em> modified
            version of the 80's synthwave inspired masterpiece <a class="j-link"
